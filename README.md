# Description

This example aims to show a basic example on *how to integrate the map library
"leaflet"*.

Additionally, since we will be using React, we will add a second
*library called "react-leaflet"*, which simply wraps "leaflet" extending its
functionality to expose it as React components.

These libraries are "unrelated"in the sense that are develop by different people

There is a third dependency that we will be using for Typescript support: "@types/leaflet"
